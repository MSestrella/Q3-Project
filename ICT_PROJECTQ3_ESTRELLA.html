            <h2>Frank Ocean</h2>
            <p><strong>Where did the name Frank Ocean comes from?</strong> The name was inspired by Frank Sinatra and his 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean’s 11. While the name itself has simple enough origins, the decision to come up with a stage name was one of necessity.

“For me, the genesis of that name change came from me trying to make a project without my label knowing about it. It was born from a need,” Ocean explained to Essence.

“I hear certain people say that about their name, their look, even their sound, that it’s a form of armor or a shield from whatever pain they might not want to feel,” he continued. “I don’t think that was it, though. I was just trying to be slick, so I could do what I was doing without people knowing. And it worked.”
